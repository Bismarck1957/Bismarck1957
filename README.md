- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bismarck1957
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a lot of things, but mostly writing, tanks, video games, anime, spending time with firends, DnD, and a couple more things,
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML and C# when I get a chance to. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not too sure yet, but I hope to become better at website building and game development.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Discord is probably the fastest way (bismarck1957), with email being a close second (bismarck1957@mail.ru).
