- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bismarck1957
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a lot of things, but mostly writing, tanks, video games, anime, spending time with firends, DnD, and a couple more things,
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML, CSS, and Javascript in my spare time. May not be good at it, but I try my best.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I don't really know. I'll figure something to work on with. I can say, however, that a little project called the Daily Ration is my chief project I work on extensively. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Discord is probably the fastest way (Щ-34@9234), with email being a close second (bismarck1957@mail.ru).
